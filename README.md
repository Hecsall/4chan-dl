# 4chan-dl
Simple 4chan image downloader (WIP)

I will work on this when i have more time.


### Requirements
For now this requires 2 components:

_pip install requests_
_pip install lxml_


### Usage
python3 4chan-dl.py

Then input the Thread URL and it will download all the images he found.
Downloaded images will be saved in the *same folder* of the python script. In the future i will make it to create a separate folder.
